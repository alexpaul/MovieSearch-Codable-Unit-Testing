Using URLSession and Codable to make requests to the iTunes Search API

## URLSession 

**URLSession.shared** - singleton instance of a URLSession  

For basic requests, the URLSession class provides a [shared](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/1409000-shared) singleton session object that gives you a reasonable default behavior for creating tasks. Use the shared session to fetch the contents of a URL to memory with just a few lines of code.

Unlike the other session types, you don’t create the shared session; you merely access it by using this property directly. As a result, you don’t provide a delegate or a configuration object.
